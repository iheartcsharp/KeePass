# KeePass

My goal is to update KeePass to use .NET Core and the latest version of C#/Visual Studio. Currently I have checked in the latest code from the official KeePass website: https://keepass.info/download.html

First I will apply the common refactorings (auto-indentation, braces around if statements, etc).
